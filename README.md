# Predict Heart Failure with SVM and ANN

I began by exploring the 12 original features to understand their relation to heart failure. I then chose the top 5 features for both SVM and ANN models and evaluated their performance.

# Dataset Information

The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data/data">Heart Failure Prediction</a> is obtained from Kaggle. Dataset from Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman: Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone.
